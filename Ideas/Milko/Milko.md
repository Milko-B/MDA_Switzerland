## Milko's Ideas

**First Idea**

Students are usually blamed for the noise and trouble in Leuven. Is this accurate? Compare the data throughout the week, throughout the (academic) year. Do we see cyclic behaviour in the amount of noise complaints and can we trace it over the academic year? Can we link nighs with heavy nuisance to certain student events? Loko should has a "LOKO Overlastkalender" specifically designed to track potentially problematic events. Getting this shouldn't be difficult

Concretely: Make a simple graph tracking nuisance events throughout the year and add some explanations to the worst evenings 


**Wild Idea**

Make an app that takes in one's google maps data (tracking where you have been) and see if it is possible that you caused some of the events in the database
