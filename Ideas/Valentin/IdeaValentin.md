## Valentin's Idea

**First Idea**

My first project idea would be to develop a noise pollution forecasting app for Leuven that predicts noise levels in different parts of the city using weather, traffic, and other relevant data. 

The app would be based on a machine learning model(which one can be determined later) that is trained on the weather,traffic(google api) and noise data and can be used to forecast noise levels in real time or even in the coming days(based on the predicted traffic and predicted weather). 

This app could be useful for city planners, policymakers, or even students looking for an apartment in Leuven who are interested in finding an apartment in a quiet area.

**Second Idea**

I think that we can create a noise predicting model, that uses the following features for a certain location and that needs to predict the noise level at that location in DBA:

1. Time,Day of the week, month of the year
2. Weather conditions: temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, rain intensity, solar radiation
3. Traffic conditions: number of cars, number of trucks, number of buses, number of pedestrians, number of cyclists, number of motorbikes circulating in trough that location in a certain time period

We train it on the beginning of the naamsestraat and we test it on the end of the naamsestraat or we find noise data for another street in Leuven and we test it on that street.
