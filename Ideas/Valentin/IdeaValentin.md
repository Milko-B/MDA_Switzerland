## Valentin's Idea

**First Idea**

My first project idea would be to develop a noise pollution forecasting app for Leuven that predicts noise levels in different parts of the city using weather, traffic, and other relevant data. 

The app would be based on a machine learning model(which one can be determined later) that is trained on the weather,traffic(google api) and noise data and can be used to forecast noise levels in real time or even in the coming days(based on the predicted traffic and predicted weather). 

This app could be useful for city planners, policymakers, or even students looking for an apartment in Leuven who are interested in finding an apartment in a quiet area.
