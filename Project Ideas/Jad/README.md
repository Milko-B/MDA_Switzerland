## Graphs
SO far the graphs dont make much sense. I am trying to see the relation between temperature and the noise level in an example of His Hers salon
![plot1](output1.png)
![plot2](output2.png)

## What to consider
- Let's consider days like Thursday (party days), or end of examination periods where more people get drunk and party around town.
- Consider the weather conditions (logically, on a good weather day more people will go out, specially beginning of spring)

## What to look at

- Create some model based on parameters (to discuss) to see what is the balance needed between people sleeping and nightlife
- Noise Levels outside bars are higher than let's say a random rental agency for example, specially at night, we can keep that in mind
- (MAYBE) look at external data like social media activity around naamsestraat area (although i dont think its possible to find such data)
  

## METHODS

- I always think Neural Networks are a good idea so maybe we can do something with it
